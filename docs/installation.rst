Installation

*Fit Curve* is a **Modifier asset**, meaning it is installed as part of Blender’s **Asset Library** rather than a traditional add-on. Once set up, you can access it directly from the **Deform** category in Blender’s modifier menu.

Step 1: Download the Asset File
--------------------------------

1. Download the *Fit Curve* ``.blend`` file.
2. Save it to a location where you want to store your **Blender Asset Library**.

Step 2: Set Up Your Asset Library in Blender
--------------------------------------------

If you haven’t already set up an **Asset Library**, follow these steps:

#. Open **Blender** and go to **Edit → Preferences**.
#. Navigate to the **File Paths** section.
#. Under **Asset Libraries**, click the **+** (*Add New*) button.
#. Name the library (e.g., “My Assets”) and select the folder where you saved the *Fit Curve* ``.blend`` file.
#. Click **Save Preferences**.

You can then follow the steps in :ref:`How to Use<quick_start>`.
